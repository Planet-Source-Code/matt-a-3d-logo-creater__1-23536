### Description

Create and manipulate 3D Logos. Apply bitmap,jpeg,gif textures to the fonts or just use colors. Apply filters to textures (nearest,linear,mipmapped) My VB installation is messed up a bit so couldn't use common dialogue to choose fonts but if anyone wants should be able to implement that quickly.

Uses API's to save the openGL scene as a bitmap

and a few to setup the openGL scene

No help file included check the code to see what keys do what.

Requires vbogl.tlb

'I got from http://is6.pacific.net.hk/~edx/tlb.htm

and ogl32.dll

'which should be included in most systems
